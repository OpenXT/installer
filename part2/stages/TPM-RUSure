 You have elected to install ${PRODUCT_BRAND}
 without configuring ${PRODUCT_BRAND} Measured
 Launch.  Doing so will invalidate some
 XT security features.

 Either \ZbReconsider\ZB this and go back to
 configure ${PRODUCT_BRAND} Measured Launch,
 \ZbAcknowledge\ZB these risks to continue 
 with Measured Launch disabled, or
 \ZbAbort\ZB the install.

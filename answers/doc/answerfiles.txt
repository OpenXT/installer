Answerfiles for OpenXT installation
######################################################################

The answerfile is located by examining the kernel command line.

answerfile=/file/included/in/the/initrd
answerfile=http://foo.bar/this/is/my.answerfile
answerfile=ftp://foo.bar/this/is/my.answerfile
answerfile=tftp://foo.bar/this/is/my.answerfile
answerfile=dev://sda1/this/is/my.answerfile

Answerfiles retrieved over the network are currently reached by
bringing up the NIC with DHCP.

Optional:
answerfile_nw="eth0"
For an answerfile retrieved over the network on a machine with more
than one NIC, answerfile_nw specifies which NIC to use.

######################################################################
Answerfile tags

The answerfile is an approximate-xml file.
Each tag is expected to be contained on a single line
in the file (ie. <tag> </tag> with no newlines).
The exceptions to this rule are the pre and post install scripts, and
the quick-options tag.

As the tag is not parsed with a true xml parser, it may be fragile.
Caution advised.

######################################################################
<interactive>true</interactive>
<interactive>false</interactive>

Determines whether the install runs with the local interactive console
enabled or not.

######################################################################
<quick-option>
# other answerfile tags here
</quick-option>

If present, this is used by the interactive installer to present two
options on the initial install screen:
- Quick install
- Advanced install

If Quick install is selected, then the answertags inbetween
<quick-option> and </quick-option> are used. If Advanced install
is selected, then they are ignored.

######################################################################
<eula accept="yes"></eula>
<eula accept="defer"></eula>

Required for automated installation.

The "yes" option indicates that the end-user license agreement has
been accepted. The user will not be prompted to accept the agreement
during the installation.

The "defer" option indicates that the user should be prompted to
accept the end-user license agreement when the system is first booted.

If this option is not present, an interactive installation will prompt
the user to accept the end-user license agreement.

######################################################################
<source type="url">http://127.0.0.1/foo/bar</source>
<source type="bootmedia"></source>
<source type="local" verify="true"></source>
<source type="harddisk" oem="true"></source>

Required.

The URL option can use either http or ftp.

The "local" option is for optical media installs, and the "verify"
flag can determine whether or not the media should be verified
prior to performing the installation.

To use the "bootmedia" option, the installer initrd must be repacked
to include a copy of the "packages.main" repository at the root of the
filesystem. A copy of this repository can be found on the installation
ISO. This option enables PXE-only network installation in situations
where network installation via the other options is not feasible.

The "harddisk" option is for installing from a hard disk partition. To
prepare a bootable partition from which OpenXT can be installed, first
boot from the installer CD-ROM, then switch to a shell and use the
"prepare-hd-install" script to copy the installer and repository from
the CD-ROM to the partition. The "oem" option indicates that the
installer should treat this as an OEM partition when partitioning the
disk (see the "partition-mode" tag below).

######################################################################
<mode>fresh</mode>
<mode>upgrade</mode>

Required for automated installation.
Indicates whether to perform a destructive fresh installation or
to upgrade an existing install.

######################################################################
<primary-disk>sda</primary-disk>

Required for automated installation if more than a single disk is
detected on the machine.

######################################################################
<partition-mode>overwrite</partition-mode>
<partition-mode>use-free-space</partition-mode>
<partition-mode>erase-non-oem</partition-mode>
<partition-mode>erase-entire-disk</partition-mode>
<partition-mode></partition-mode>

Determines what changes are made to the partition layout of the
primary disk when performing a fresh installation.

The "overwrite" option will overwrite an existing installation. All
other partitions on the disk will be preserved. This option is only
available if there is an existing installation on the disk.

The "use-free-space" option will install into the available free space
on the disk. All existing partitions on the disk will be preserved.
This option is only available if free space exists on the disk, a new
primary partition can be created and there is no existing installation
on the disk.

The "erase-non-oem" option will preserve any OEM partitions, erasing
all other partitions on the disk and installing into the available
space. (At present only Dell Utility Partitions are detected as OEM
partitions.)

The "erase-entire-disk" option will erase all partitions on the disk
and install into the free space. All existing partitions will be
erased.

If no option is specified for an automated installation, the installer
will attempt to use the following options in order: "overwrite",
"use-free-space", "erase-non-oem" and "erase-entire-disk".

######################################################################
<install-mbr>true</install-mbr>
<install-mbr>false</install-mbr>
<install-mbr>auto</install-mbr>
<install-mbr><install-mbr>

Optional.

Determines whether a new master boot record is installed on the target
disk.

The "auto" option will install a new master boot record unless an OEM
master boot record is found on the target disk. (At present only Dell
master boot records are detected.)

Defaults to "auto" if no option is specified.

######################################################################
<network-interface mode="dhcp"></network-interface>
<network-interface mode="static" address="10.0.0.1" netmask="255.255.255.0" gateway="10.0.0.2" dns="10.0.0.3"></network-interface>

Configure the network device for use by the installer.
Required for automated installs performed over the network.

######################################################################
<language>en-us</language>
<language defer="true"></language>

Sets the language for the installed system. The only language
supported for this release is:

    en-us    (English)

If the "defer" option is specified, the user will be prompted to set
the language on first boot.

######################################################################
<keyboard>us</keyboard>
<keyboard defer="true"></keyboard>

Used to set the keyboard layout. The following keyboard layouts are
supported:

    cn (China)
    fr (France)
    de (Germany)
    it (Italy)
    jp (Japan)
    es (Spain)
    ch (Switzerland)
    gb (United Kingdom)
    us (United States)

If the "defer" option is specified, the user will be prompted to set
the keyboard layout on first boot.

######################################################################
<password></password>
<password>$1$GPuyWcYF$9THzAqZQku1cIo/2E81uU0</password>
<password defer="true"></password>

Used to set the system password. The value is assumed to be an
MD5-based encrypted password. An empty password is allowed and will
permit access without entering a password.

If the "defer" option is specified, the system password will not be
set, and the user will be prompted to set the password on first boot.

The following command can be used to generate an encrypted password:

    $ openssl passwd -1

######################################################################
<recovery-password>RecoveryPassword</recovery-password>

This is a plaintext password used as the system recovery password for
unlocking the config partition.  The installer will try and sanitize
this password out of the answerfile.

If you are concerned about plaintext passwords in your answerfile, add a
snippet like:
<preinstall>
#!/bin/sh
source /usr/lib/openxt/key-functions
setup_keystore
cd \${KEYMNT}
wget -q -O - http://\$http_server/keys.tar.gz | tar -zxf -
store_recovery_key recovery_password
rm recovery_password
</preinstall>
to your answer file to populate the Recovery password where keys.tar.gz
contains the recovery_password file.

######################################################################
<tpm-owner-password>TPMOwnerPassword</tpm-owner-password>

This is a plaintext password used as the TPM Owner password for TPM 1.2
systems and as the Owner, Endorsement and Lockout passwords for TPM 2.0.
The installer will try and sanitize this password out of the answerfile.

If you are concerned about plaintext passwords in your answerfile, add a
snippet like:
<preinstall>
#!/bin/sh
source /usr/lib/openxt/key-functions
setup_keystore
cd \${KEYMNT}
wget -q -O - http://\$http_server/keys.tar.gz | tar -zxf -
store_recovery_key recovery_password
store_own_key tpm_owner_password
rm recovery_password tpm_owner_password
</preinstall>
to your answer file to populate the TPM Owner password and Recovery
password where keys.tar.gz contains files recovery_password and
tpm_owner_password.

######################################################################
<enable-ssh>true</enable-ssh>
<enable-ssh>false</enable-ssh>

Optional.
Enables external ssh access to dom0 for diagnostic purposes.

Defaults to "false" is no option is specified.

######################################################################
<license-key></license-key>

Optional.
Used to supply the system license key.
Not currently functional.

######################################################################
<vhds>
  <vhd label="vhd1" compress="gzip">
    <vhd-sources>
      <vhd-source>dev://sda1/my.vhd.part1</vhd-source>
      <vhd-source>dev://sda1/my.vhd.part2</vhd-source>
    </vhd-sources>
  </vhd>
</vhds>

Optional.

Installs a precreated virtual hard disk on to the system.

Each "vhd" block specifies a virtual hard disk to be installed. (At
present only one virtual hard disk can be specified.) A new UUID
(universally unique identifier) will be assigned to the virtual hard
disk on installation.

The "label" option specifies a unique label for the virtual hard disk
which can be referenced in the "vms" block (see below). This label is
only used during the installation process.

The "vhd-source" tag specifies the source of the virtual hard disk
image. Valid prefixes include "http://", "ftp://", "file://" and
"dev://". Note that the image will be retrieved after partitioning the
target disk, so if the "dev://" prefix is used, it must not refer to a
partition which is erased during the installation process.

If the "vhd-source" tag is specified multiple times, it is assumed
that the image has been split into fragments (e.g. to work around a
file size limit on the source filesystem) which must be concatenated
to recover the original image.

The "compress" option indicates that the image has been compressed.
Valid values are "gzip" and "bzip2". If the image has also been split,
it is assumed that the image was split after compression.

######################################################################
<vms>
  <vm>
    <vm-source>http://my.url/my-vm.db</vm-source>
    <vm-vhds>
      <vm-vhd index="0" label="vhd1"></vm-vhd>
    <vm-vhds>
  </vm>
</vms>

Optional.

Installs a precreated virtual machine on to the system.

Each "vm" block specifies a virtual machine to be installed. (At
present only one virtual machine can be specified.) A new UUID will be
assigned to the virtual machine on installation.

The "vm-source" tag specifies the source of the configuration file
for the virtual machine. Valid prefixes include "http://", "ftp://",
"file://" and "dev://". Note that the file will be retrieved after
partitioning the target disk, so if the "dev://" prefix is used, it
must not refer to a partition which is erased during the installation
process.

The configuration file will automatically be updated to reflect the
virtual machine's new UUID.

The optional "vm-vhds" block allows the configuration file to be
updated to reflect the new UUIDs of any virtual hard disks used by the
virtual machine. Each "vm-vhd" tag specifies the index of the disk as
listed within the configuration file and the label of the disk as
specified in the "vhd" block (see above).

######################################################################
<skipready></skipready>

Optional.
If this tag is present, skip the "are you ready to install?"
interactive screen.

######################################################################
<preinstall>#!/bin/ash
touch /tmp/i.was.here
</preinstall>

Optional.
Used to supply a script that will be executed prior to the install
sequence being executed.
Note that including answertags in the preinstall script may confuse
the answerfile parser: caution advised.

######################################################################
<postinstall>#!/bin/ash
touch /tmp/no.i.wasnt
</postinstall>

Optional.
A post install script, executed at the end of a successful install
sequence.
